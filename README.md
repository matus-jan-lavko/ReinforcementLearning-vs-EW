# ReinforcementLearning-vs-EW

This is a repository of my Bachelor's thesis project Reinforcement Learning vs. 1/n and Mean-Variance Optimization In The Portfolio Allocation Problem. In this project I am testing a number of model-free Reinforcement Learning algorithms based on the framework from https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09607 written on top of OPENAI stable-baselines.
